<blockquote><p class="justify">During the Berlinale Film Festival this 3D short film starring the Audi fleet shuttle quattro will be shown on the "Audi ultra powerwall" at Audi City Berlin.</p></blockquote> 

<h4>Universal Car Rig</h4> 
<p class="justify">The car was rigged with a universal car rig created to work with any sized vehicle with 4 wheels setup to be used for any car related project at the company. The setup features a lot of high-end controls like tire pressure on the tires and a dynamics system for the suspension that could be blended with manual controls in case adjustments had to be made by the animators. The rig could be attached to a motion path with a simple gui to make sure the steering would be attached and prevent sliding on the tires.</p> 

<h4>Robot Head Rig</h4> 
<p class="justify">The robot head was rigged with a very simple body, head an facial control. These few controls moved a lot of parts in the neck and face in a mechanical way. The rig was animated by attaching body tracking data and having this data cleaned up by the animators.</p>

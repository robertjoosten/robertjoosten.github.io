<p class="justify">A straight forward project where a drone had to be rigged. The drone used is a state-of-the-art drone which can rotate its feet out of view of the camera, shifting its center of gravity. Due to the rig being created at the very early stages of the project, all of this complexities had to be rigged to cover all our bases. As you can see by watching the commercial the drone is airborne at all times not having to display this complexity.</p>

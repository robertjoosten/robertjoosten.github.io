<p class="justify">The first project I had the pleasure of working on at Realtime. The rigging approach that this project required was a bit different than what I was used to, first of all because of the in-game element but also because we had to extend the existing rigs from Rare due to the then non-existing rigging pipeline. Most in the industry will know that it is harder to up-res an asset than down-res one, adding extra functionality into existing rigs came with its own unique set of problems.</p> 

<p class="justify">To push for the best possible quality we wanted to simulate the clothes, hair etc. on most of the characters. Because the game was still running on an older version of Unreal we were forced to bake these simulations back onto the joints. I've quickly build some tools for the Houdini artists to use and automate this process which saved valuable time.</p>

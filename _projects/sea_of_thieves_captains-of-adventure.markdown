<p class="justify">As the rigging tools were more established during this project we could use a rebuild workflow. The skeletal meshes from Rare are deconstructed into separate skeleton and geometry publishes which are recompiled by <a href="https://robertjoosten.github.io/projects/frankenstein/">Frankenstein</a>. Having re-established the iterative rigging process it gave us a lot more freedom to up-res geometry and add additional rig components/blendshapes to improve the overall deformation and level of control for the animators.</p>

<p class="justify"><a href="https://robertjoosten.github.io/projects/frankenstein/">Frankenstein</a> is able to hook into 3rd party skeletons and drive them using its own rig components. This will allow the exported skeletal animation to be used directly onto the engine assets. Another benefit of this is that all our animation/mocap tools will work with this rig rather than using Rare's control rig.</p>

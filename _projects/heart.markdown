<p class="justify">The human heart rig is an example of the work I have done at <a href="https://www.touchsurgery.com/">Touch Surgery</a>. For one of the surgical procedures we needed a beating heart. For this particular procedure only the external anatomy was necessary. Once this was done I decided it was time to have a little bit of fun and work on the internal anatomy as well. With the guidance of the anatomists at Touch Surgery, it was possible achieve an anatomically correct animation. Because the human heart is so complex I added the possibility to slice the geometry any which way thinkable, this makes it possible to visualise exactly the area of interest.</p>

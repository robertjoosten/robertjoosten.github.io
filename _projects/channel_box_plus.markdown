<p class="justify">ChannelBoxPlus will add search-ability over its attributes and it will colour user defined attributes, making them easier to distinguish. With the threshold argument you can determine when to switch between colours, the higher the threshold the more the 2 attributes will have to match up to stay the same colour, this value can be adjusted in the userSetup.py.</p>

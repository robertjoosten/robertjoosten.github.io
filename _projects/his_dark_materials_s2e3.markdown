<p class="justify">Really pleased to have been part of an excellent team that brought the Lemur to life. It featured briefly in a couple of shots in the third episode of the second season.</p> 

<p class="justify">The rigging of this character posed a couple of interesting problems like being able to switch between biped and quadruped mode. The animators feedback was essential to make sure I created exactly what they wanted to be able to complete the work on a short deadline. The modellers created a beautiful base model and an extensive set of facial shapes which made my job a lot easier, but also put the pressure on to make sure I reached a similar level of quality.</p>

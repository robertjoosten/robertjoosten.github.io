<blockquote><p class="justify">The ad shows off Sword and Shield’s gameplay by manifesting the classic Pokémon characters and their environments in the real world. Using production design and digital matte painting, Framestore transformed a picturesque English village into a mirror of the Galar region of the game itself.</p></blockquote> 

<p class="justify">Getting to rig a pokémon has always been high on my bucket list, it was such a fun project to work on. Due to the incredible time constraints the rigging team at <a href="https://www.framestore.com/work/pokemon-sword-pokemon-shield">Framestore</a> had to come together and we got to do one pokémon each. </p>

<p class="justify">I've had the pleasure to create the rig for Sobble. Luckily there was already quite a bit of reference footage available for the three starter pokémon in the game. It was very important to make sure that the rigs would support the kind of animation that fits within the pokémon world.</p>

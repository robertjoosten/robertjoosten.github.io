<h4>Installation</h4> 
* Extract the content of the .rar file anywhere on disk.
* Drag the reorderAttributes.mel file in Maya to permanently install the script.

<h4>Note</h4> 
<p class="justify">A button called Reorder Attributes will be added to the Channel Box -> Edit menu. Clicking this button will open up an ui that will allow the user to drag and drop the attributes to reorder. Attributes are deleted in the new order and the undo commands is then ran to redo the attributes in the order preferred. A thank you too Nick Hughes for showing me the power of the undo command and how it can be used to sort attributes.</p>

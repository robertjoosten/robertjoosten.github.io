<p class="justify">It took a long time after completion to be able to see the work on the James Bond - No Time To Die opening sequence. As always it is a beautiful creative piece with lots of bright colours and crazy things happening.</p>

<p class="justify">The most interesting bit of rigging I had to do was the scene with all of the cogs, due to the ever changing nature of these shots the build process was completely automated to detect new/removed/updated cogs coming through from the modellers. The connected cogs were combined into a network of which animators could adjust the overal speed, but also have full control over each cog if desired.</p>

<p class="justify">The Christmas period is always a good one to be working in Advertising as it seems ( to me at least ) that it is the time the best projects come in. When I was told I'd get to work on another Lego&#174; project I was over the moon and thought after having rigged <a href="../lego_wall_e">Wall-E</a> it would be a walk in the park. Once introduced to the project it was immediately clear that no Lego&#174; bricks needed rigging, it did give me the opportunity to build a wide variety of rig over many franchises I admire.</p>

<p class="justify">In the main commercial a lot of the characters have very little screen time, other clips where made with additional footage:</p>
